PYTHON - DATA STRUTURES: Lists and Tuples

In Python, data structures are essential tools for organizing and manipulating collections of data. Two commonly used data structures are lists and tuples.

LISTS

1. Lists are ordered collections of items enclosed in square brackets [ ].
2. They can store elements of different data types (integers, strings, boolean, etc.).
3. Lists are mutable, meaning you can add, remove, or modify elements after creation.
4. You can access elements in a list by their position (index) in the list.
Example:
my_list = [1, 'apple', 3.14, True]

TUPLES

1. Tuples are ordered collections of items enclosed in parentheses ( ).
2. Like lists, they can store elements of different data types.
3. Tuples are immutable, so you cannot change their contents once created.
4. You can access tuple elements by their position (index) as well.
Example:
my_tuple = (42, 'banana', 2.71, False)

COMMON USE CASES

1. If you need a collection you can modify, use a list.
2. If your data should remain constant, use a tuple to prevent accidental changes.

CHOOSING BETWEEN LISTS AND TUPLES

1. If you need a collection you can modify, use a list.
2. If your data should remain constant, use a tuple to prevent accidental changes.

Understanding lists and tuples is fundamental for Python programming, and selecting the appropriate data structure 
can significantly impact your code's performance and reliability.
