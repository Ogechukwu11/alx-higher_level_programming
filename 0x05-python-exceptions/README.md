PYTHON EXCEPTIONS

Overview

Exception handling is a crucial aspect of writing robust and error-resistant Python code. Exceptions provide a way to gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent your program from crashing. Understanding how to use exceptions will help you write more reliable and maintainable code.

Basics

In Python, exceptions are raised when an error occurs during program execution. They interrupt the normal flow and transfer control to an exception-handling block.

Syntax:

1. try block: Contains the code where an exception might occur.
2. except block: Catches and handles the specified exception.

Common Exceptions

1. ZeroDivisionError: Raised when division or modulo by zero is encountered.
2. FileNotFoundError: Raised when trying to access a file that doesn't exist.
3. TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
4. ValueError: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but with an invalid value.

Handling Multiple Exceptions

You can handle multiple exceptions by specifying multiple except blocks or using a tuple.

Conclusion

Understanding and effectively using exceptions is a fundamental skill in Python programming. Proper exception handling enhances the reliability of your code and makes it more resilient to unforeseen issues.
