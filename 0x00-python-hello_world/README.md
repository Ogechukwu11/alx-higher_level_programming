PYTHON: GETTING STARTED
Hello, World!
Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program in Python. It's as simple as this:
print("Hello, World!")

Python's readability shines even in this basic example. You don't need semicolons or complex syntaxâ€”just plain, easy-to-understand code.

INTERACTIVE MODE
Python offers an interactive mode where you can experiment with code on the fly. Open your terminal, type python, and you're ready to go. Try out small code snippets, calculations, and test ideas quickly.

SCRIPT MODE
For larger projects, Python's script mode is your go-to. Write your code in a .py file (e.g., my_program.py) and run it using python my_program.py. Now you can create more complex programs and reusable functions.

STRINGS
Strings are a fundamental part of Python. You can define them with single or double quotes. Manipulating strings, from simple concatenation to advanced text processing, is a breeze in Python.
Example:
name = "Alice"
greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"
print(greeting)

PEP 8 (PYCODESTYLE)
To keep your code clean and consistent, follow the PEP 8 style guide. Tools like pycodestyle can help you check for adherence to these guidelines, ensuring your code is easy to read and maintain.

ZEN OF PYTHON
Python's philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python, a collection of guiding principles. To view it, open a Python terminal and type import this. It's a reminder to keep your code beautiful, readable, and explicit.
