PYTHON - MORE DATA STRUCTURES: SET, DICTIONARY

SETS: What They Are and How to Use Them

In Python, a set is a collection of unique elements. You can create sets with curly braces {} or the set() constructor. Sets are fantastic for eliminating duplicates and performing set operations like union and intersection.

Common Set Methods:

1. add(): Add an element to a set.
2. remove(): Remove an element from a set.
3. union(): Combine two sets.
4. intersection(): Find common elements between sets.

Sets vs. Lists

Use sets when you need to store unique elements and lists for ordered collections with duplicates.

Iterating through Sets

You can iterate through a set using a for loop, just like with lists.

Dictionaries: What They Are and How to Use Them

A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. It's like a real-world dictionary where you look up a word to find its definition. In Python, you look up a "key" to get its "value."

When to Use Dictionaries

Use dictionaries when you need to associate unique keys with specific values. They are excellent for data organization and quick look-up.

Dictionary Keys

Keys in a dictionary are unique identifiers for values. They must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, or tuples).

Iterating over Dictionaries

Use a for loop to iterate through dictionaries. You can access both keys and values using methods like .keys(), .values(), and .items().

Lambda Functions

Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions used for short, specific tasks. They have a simple syntax: lambda arguments: expression.

Map, Reduce, and Filter Functions

map(): Applies a function to all items in an iterable.
reduce(): Aggregates values in an iterable using a function.
filter(): Filters elements based on a condition.

These functions are incredibly useful for data manipulation and transformation.
